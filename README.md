# SCT_CS_04
This project demonstrates a simple keylogger built using Python and the pynput library. It listens to keyboard events and logs each keypress to a local text file (key_log.txt). The script is intended for educational and ethical cybersecurity research only, such as learning how keylogging works and how to detect or prevent it.
